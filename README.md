A CSS-only recreation of the opening moment of The Radiance fight from Hollow Knight. This project focuses on replicating the game’s UI and atmosphere, including the “Challenge the Radiance” prompt, the Radiance’s entrance onto the screen, and her idle floating animation. It is built purely with HTML and CSS, with all visuals and animations being preset and non-interactive, and is intended solely as a learning exercise to practice layout, positioning, layering, and animation timing. The project is fan-made, non-commercial, and created for educational purposes, with all visual inspiration belonging to Hollow Knight by Team Cherry.
